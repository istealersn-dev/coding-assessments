# Coding Assessments Collection

This repository contains a collection of coding problems organized for interview use. Files were normalized and organized without modifying their contents.

## Structure
- `problems/` — one folder per problem, each with a `Problem.md` and any provided solutions or artifacts.
- `templates/` — reusable materials like the interview README template.

## Notes
- Only file/folder names and layout were changed for consistency; no content edits.
- Original problem names were converted to kebab‑case folder names.

## Quick Start
- Browse problems under `problems/`.
- Use `INTERVIEW_README_TEMPLATE.md` (also copied to `templates/`) to create per‑exercise instructions.
